        <h4 CLASS="fs-2"><b>THE SOLAR SYSTEM</b></h4>
        <p>[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. Of the bodies that orbit
          the
          Sun directly, the largest are the four gas and ice giants and the four terrestrial planets, followed by an
          unknown number of dwarf planets and innumerable small Solar System bodies. Of the bodies that orbit the Sun
          indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than Mercury, the smallest terrestrial planet, and one is
          nearly as large.[d] The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
          interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the
          remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are
          terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the outer system
          are
          substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants,
          being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed
          mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles,
          such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight have nearly circular orbits that lie close to the plane of the
          Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.</p>

          perfect

          plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly
          as
          visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for
          life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its
          mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar
          System.[20] Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium
          (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.[21] <br>

        <p><b>MERCURY</b> is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the
          Sun
          takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
          (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the
          Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and
          its
          apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the
          planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually
          in
          twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than
          Venus.
          From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon,
          which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p>

        <p><b>VENUS</b> is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As
          the
          brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the
          naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19] Venus' orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is
          47°; thus, it can be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a couple of hours before
          or
          after sunrise or sunset, depending on the observer's latitude and on the positions of Venus and the Sun. Most
          of
          the time, it can be seen either in the morning or in the evening. At some times, it may even be seen a while
          in
          a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a synodic day length of 117
          Earth
          days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
          than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means
          that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east.[21] Venus does not have any moons, a
          distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.[22]</p>
